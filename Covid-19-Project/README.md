- COVID-19 DATA EXPLORATION
  
- This project will explore global Covid deaths and vaccination data between 01/01/2020 and 30/04/2021 using MS SQL Server Management Studio.
- After importing the datasets from Excel to MS SQL SMS, I worked data exploration skills, using basic SQL queries such as SELECT, FROM, WHERE as well as some more advanced techniques such as Joins, CTE, and Temp tables.
